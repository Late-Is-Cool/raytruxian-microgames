# Raytruxian Inc. Microgames

its a game alright

guy name raytrux opens up a game company, and uhh who cares about story, we'll do that later

you can find latest debug builds [here](https://github.com/Late-Is-Cool/raytruxian-microgames/actions)

windows builds doesnt have the .exe extension in the game file, do you have to manually add it in (until we figure it out)
